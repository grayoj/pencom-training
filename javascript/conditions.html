<!-- What are conditional statements?
Conditional statements are methods that are used to perform certain actions
based on a certain condition. For
IF is used to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is true
ELSE is used to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false
ELSE IF is used to specify a condition test, if the first condition is false
SWITCH is used to specify alternative blocks of code to be executed
